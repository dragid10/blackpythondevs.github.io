We are thrilled to announce a significant new partnership between Black Python Devs and [PyOhio](https://www.pyohio.org/2024/)! This collaboration marks a major milestone in our mission to amplify the involvement of Black developers within the Python community, with a particular focus on the Ohio region. Our financial support for PyOhio is designed to stimulate community engagement and foster growth in the years to come.

PyOhio, a free annual conference dedicated to the Python programming language, is based in Ohio and caters to a wide range of Python enthusiasts. Their content spans from beginner to advanced levels, aiming to be relevant to a diverse audience including students, software professionals, scientists, hobbyists, and anyone interested in learning more about Python. This mission closely aligns with our goals at Black Python Devs, where we strive to encourage and support Black developers globally, promoting their participation in Python conferences such as PyOhio.

During the announcement of this partnership, our founder, Jay Miller, shared his enthusiasm:

> "We are excited to work with the PyOhio team. The PyCon US event in Cleveland was the most diverse location a PyCon US event has been held in the last 10 years. We want to continue to show other communities that when you extend your communities into locations where there are many talented Black present and future developers, we are able to make a positive impact across the board. We are encouraged by PyOhio's ambition and eagerness to work with us and hope they will serve as a standard for other communities across the United States."

This partnership is a pivotal step in our efforts to support Black Python developers, starting with those in Ohio. We aim to increase their participation and engagement in the PyOhio community conference through volunteering, speaking, and other collaborative efforts. Our excitement about this partnership is immense, and we look forward to a long and fruitful collaboration with PyOhio.

At this year's PyOhio conference, the Black Python Devs will have a dedicated Black Python Devs booth, and we encourage all attendees to visit and show their support. This partnership promises to be a cornerstone of our efforts to foster a more inclusive and engaged Python community.

We are excited about the future and the positive impact this collaboration will have on our community. Here's to many more years of growth and success together with PyOhio!
