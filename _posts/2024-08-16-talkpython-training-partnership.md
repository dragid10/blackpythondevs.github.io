We are excited to announce a new partnership with TalkPython Training!

When purchasing a course, you can use the promo code `bpd-20pc-1c1da` to receive a 10% discount. When you do this Black Python Devs will receive a 20% commission on the sale.

This is a great way to support Black Python Devs and invest in your own learning all at the same time. We hope you take advantage of this opportunity.

## Extending a Long Time Partnership

This is the second partnership that we've done with TalkPython Training. Since our earliest days, Michael Kennedy the founder of the site has been a supporter of Black Python Devs. We are grateful for his continued support and look forward to working with him in the future.
